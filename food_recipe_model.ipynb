Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Butter a 9-inch springform pan. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour and sugar. Add the butter and beat until the mixture is crumbly. Gradually add the milk and stir until well blended. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 35 minutes. The cake should be a rich, golden brown. Cool in the pan on a wire rack. Turn the cakes out of the pans and onto a serving plate. Place a piece of wax paper over the top of each cake to prevent a skin from forming. Serve with whipped cream. Makes 10 to 12 cakes. 1/3 cup sugar\\n1/2 cup butter\\n3 eggs\\n2 cups flour\\n10 tablespoons sugar (or more if needed)\\nFor the cream cheese frosting: Beat the powdered sugar and butter in a mixer bowl until light and fluffy. Scrape down the sides of bowl and add in 1 cup powdered milk; mix until smooth. Beat in one egg at a time. Fold in another egg. Slowly add 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, then one teaspoon of powdered stevia. (Do not add more than one cup of vanilla to the frosted cake.) Spread the icing on the cooled cakes and top with the remaining powdered buttercream. Serves 6 to 8.\\n\\n\\nCook's Note: I used this recipe when I was in college. I had a lot of cake and I wanted to make it special. This\""

            "Steps: 1. Wash the green bananas thoroughly to remove any dirt. 2. Cut off both ends of each banana and make a lengthwise slit through the skin. 3. Place bananas in a pot of salted water and bring to a boil. 5. Drain the water and let the bananas cool slightly. 6. Peel the bananas and cut them into 1-inch chunks. 7. Heat oil in a large pan over medium heat. 8. Add chopped onions and sautÃ© until translucent (about 5 minutes). 9. Add minced garlic and ginger, cook for 1 minute until fragrant. 10. Add turmeric, cumin, and coriander powders, stir for 30 seconds. 11. Add chopped tomatoes and cook until they soften (about 5 minutes). 12. Add curry leaves and green chilies (if using). 13. Pour in coconut milk and bring to a simmer. 14. Add the banana chunks and gently stir to coat with the sauce. 15. Cover and cook on low heat for 10 minutes, allowing the bananas to absorb the flavors. 16. Season with salt to taste. 17. Garnish with fresh cilantro before serving.\n",
